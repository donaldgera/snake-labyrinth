# snake-labyrinth
This project, proposed as a university challenge by one of our professors to mirror the Reply Challenge 2023, focuses on developing a maze
navigation system using greedy algorithms for optimal score maximization through coin collection and exit strategies. It demonstrates the
effective use of greedy heuristics for local decisionâ€‘making towards achieving a global optimal path.
